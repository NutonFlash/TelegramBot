This bot was created for the one small company that sells beers and cigarettes in Russia. The owner of this company asked me to create online shop on the base of telegram bot in order to increase amount of sellings.
Customer technical task was consisted of these main points:
  1) implement the main menu with 6 sections - catalog, bucket, orders, about, settings, support
  2) organise the database which will includes several tables: users, orders, products
  3) calculate cost of delivery relying on location and totoal cost of order
